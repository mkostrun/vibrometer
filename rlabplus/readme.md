# rlabplus scripts

This directory contains scripts for recording data from the sensor and creating
spectrograms using gnuplot.

The scripts are

1. *main1_demo.r3*  - collect data from sensor and plot the spectrograms for each
axis once a second, all on the same plot.

2. *main2_record.r3* - collect data from sensor, plot it, and save it to three
separate files *ch1*, *ch2* and *ch3*.
