## Motivation

So I got this life-is-good front-load washing machine a few years ago. Recently it started making loud
noises during spin cycle. Finally, it would just refuse to start the spin cycle and instead
spend entire night trying to balance load and eventually stopping with an error message.

Checking of internet resources suggested that the likely cause of the problem is that the
drum bearings were gone. Posted videos suggested that the repair would be straightforward
and fairly quick.

So I ordered bearings from no-name vendor on brasilian river named web site and on the day
they were supposed to arrive started the work.
