There are two groups of spectrograms obtained from the empty washing machine
using 'Speed Wash' with wash cold, using medium spin cycle, and soil level light.
The cycle lasts some 16 minutes of which the first 10 min is the wash cycle
followed by 6 min long spin cycle.

1. Third leg with damper designated 'D1', which performance was deemed poor.

2. Third leg with damper designated 'D2', which performance was deemed satisfactory.

Fig. 1: Spectrograms for D1 (top) and D2 (bottom) for acceleration along X (up/down)
axis. Please note that with shock absorber D1 around 12.5 minute shows signs of banging:
the spectrum shows strong vibrations over range of frequencies (consistent with delta function).
Spectrogram for D1 is reacher in modes than for damper D2.

Fig. 2: Spectrograms for D1 (top) and D2 (bottom) for acceleration along Y (left/right)
axis. Same banging at around 12.5 minute is present for D1, which forces the washing machine
drum controller during the spin cycle to increase the RPM from
approximately 17 Hz (1020 RPM) to 20 Hz (1200 RPM).
For D2 the entire spin cycle is done at approximately 17 Hz.
Spectrogram for D1 is reacher in modes than for damper D2.

Fig. 3: Spectrograms for D1 (top) and D2 (bottom) for acceleration along Z (back/forth) axis.
Then the washing machine is noisier with D1 then D2 is obvious from reachness of the
excited modes of the oscillations. For D2 only the 10 Hz mode is significant with
the modulation amplitude of the order of 0.001. For D1 besides 10 Hz mode its subharmonic
at 5 Hz and 25 Hz harmonic are present, as well.
