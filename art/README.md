There are two groups of spectrograms obtained from the empty washing machine
using 'Speed Wash' with wash cold, using medium spin cycle, and soil level light.

1. Third leg with damper designated 'D1', which performance was deemed poor.

2. Third leg with damper designated 'D2', which performance was deemed satisfactory.

Fig. 1: Spectrograms for D1 (top) and D2 (bottom) for acceleration along X (up/down)
axis. Please note that D1 around 12.5 minute shows signs of banging: the spectrum shows
strong vibrations over range of frequencies (consistent with delta function).
