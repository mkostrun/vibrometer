There are two groups of spectrograms obtained from the empty washing machine
using 'Speed Wash' with wash cold, using medium spin cycle, and soil level light.

1. Third leg with damper designated 'D1', which performance was deemed poor.

2. Third leg with damper designated 'D2', which performance was deemed satisfactory.

Fig. 1: Spectrograms for D1 (top) and D2 (bottom) for acceleration along X (up/down)
axis. Please note that with shock absorber D1 around 12.5 minute shows signs of banging:
the spectrum shows strong vibrations over range of frequencies (consistent with delta function).

Fig. 2: Spectrograms for D1 (top) and D2 (bottom) for acceleration along Y (left/right)
axis. Same banging at around 12.5 minute is present for D1, which forces the washing machine
drum controller during the spin cycle to increase the RPM from
approximately 17 Hz (1020 RPM) to 20 Hz (1200 RPM).
For D2 the entire spin cycle is done at approximately 17 Hz.
